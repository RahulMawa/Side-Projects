# Phone Number Tracker
This program runs on Flask, Django, and Python 3.0

This program inputs the phone number (must be with country code) in a TextField, and the program then outputs the country that number belongs to alongside the Service Provider for that number.

Library needed for the algorithm: phonenumbers
