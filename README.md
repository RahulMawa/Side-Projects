# Side-Projects

In this repository, I share to the world all of the "Side Projects" and Programs that I make for fun. While some of them maybe pointless, and definitely all of them will be at various levels of complexity, but they were all made from the intention of 'making something fun in my free time'.

Hope you find them useful!
